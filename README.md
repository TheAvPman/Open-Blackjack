- TODO: Complete the game loop
- TODO: Complete game actions (Split, Stay, Double...)
- TODO: Check for blackjacks at first draw (dealer and user)
- TODO: Check for game losses (Over 21)
- TODO: Ask for insurance
- TODO: Place bets
- TODO: Pay winnings
- TODO: Complete dealer (CPU) turn
- TODO: Separate the game, functions and class files.

Long term goals:
- Storing the player's credit in an external file for persistence (Maybe implementing a crypto for security)
- Adding support for external inventories in Minecraft for in-game items Bets and Payouts
- Adding support for Redstone in Minecraft to have more world interaction (ie: blinking lights when winning)
- Adding a simple GUI compatible with OpenOS
- Porting the game logic to Love2D for a more modern looking game
